## Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop or Docker Engine with Docker Compose
- Git

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mnaray/roadtrip_planner.git
cd roadtrip_planner
```

### 2. Set up environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root (if not already present):

```bash
POSTGRES_DB=roadtrip_planner_development
POSTGRES_USER=roadtrip_planner
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
DATABASE_HOST=db
```

### 3. Build and run with Docker

```bash
# Build the Docker images
docker compose build

# Start the application
docker compose up

# Or run in detached mode
docker compose up -d
```

The first run will automatically:
- Install Ruby gems
- Install Node packages
- Create and migrate the database
- Start the Rails server

### 4. Access the application

Open your browser and navigate to: `http://localhost:3000`

## Development

### Running commands in the container

```bash
# Access the Rails console
docker compose exec web rails console

# Run database migrations
docker compose exec web rails db:migrate

# Run tests
docker compose exec web rspec

# Access bash shell
docker compose exec web bash
```

### Using the Makefile (optional)

A Makefile is provided for common tasks:

```bash
make build    # Build Docker images
make up       # Start services
make down     # Stop services
make logs     # View logs
make bash     # Access container shell
make reset-db # Reset database
```

### Live Reloading

The application supports live reloading:
- Rails code changes are automatically reflected
- CSS changes rebuild automatically in development
- JavaScript changes are loaded via Importmaps

### Documentation

The project includes comprehensive documentation built with Docusaurus:

```bash
# View documentation locally
cd docs
npm install
npm run start
# Open http://localhost:3001 to view documentation
```

The documentation covers:
- Complete setup and development guide
- Architecture and design patterns
- API reference and component documentation
- Testing and deployment procedures

```

## Testing

The application uses RSpec for testing:

```bash
# Run all tests
docker compose exec web rspec

# Run specific test file
docker compose exec web rspec spec/requests/user_registration_spec.rb

# Run with coverage
docker compose exec web rspec --format documentation
```

## Database Management

```bash
# Create database (usually automatic)
docker compose exec web rails db:create

# Run migrations
docker compose exec web rails db:migrate

# Seed database
docker compose exec web rails db:seed

# Reset database
docker compose exec web rails db:reset
```

## Troubleshooting

### Port already in use
If port 3000 is already in use:
```bash
# Stop the running container
docker compose down

# Or change the port in docker-compose.yml
ports:
  - "3001:3000"  # Use port 3001 instead
```

### Database connection issues
```bash
# Check database service status
docker compose ps

# View database logs
docker compose logs db

# Rebuild database
docker compose exec web rails db:drop db:create db:migrate
```

### Clear Docker cache
```bash
# Stop all services
docker compose down

# Remove volumes (WARNING: deletes data)
docker compose down -v

# Rebuild from scratch
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up
```
