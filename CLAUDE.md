## Project Overview

This is a roadtrip planner application currently in its initial stages. The repository is licensed under the MIT License.

## Repository Status

The repository is currently empty except for README.md and LICENSE files. No technology stack or build system has been chosen yet.

## Development Notes

When implementing this application, consider:
- The choice of technology stack should align with the roadtrip planning use case (likely needs map integration, route optimization, and data persistence)
- Once a technology stack is chosen, update this file with build, test, and development commands
